The Twitter Clone application has a lot of interactivity. A user can register an account and log in to the account. Once logged in, the user can Tweet on the homepage. By clicking the comment button on a tweet, the user can then make a comment on a tweet. From the home page, the user can go to their profile and view the tweets that they have made. By searching for a name in the search bar, the user can find other users and view their pages. On another user's profile page is the other user's name and a list of their tweets. Also on the other user's page is a button that can let the user follow the other user. If clicked, then the other user's tweets then display in the user's own home page. To achieve this functionality, the user can register two accounts, make tweets with each, have a user follow the other user, and then view the results on the homepage. On each of the tweets, next to the comment button, is the number of comments made on that tweet. Finally, the user can log out of the application. The technology involved is React. I have used functional components with hooks to maintain state. And I used local storage in order to maintain data structures that facilitate the creation of user accounts, tweets, comments, etc.
